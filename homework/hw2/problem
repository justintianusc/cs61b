Part I
------
Implement the basic helper methods listed below.  These methods, like the main
method, are declared "static."  They are also declared "public" so we can test
them from another class.  Don't change that.

The Unix "cal" command will remind you of the number of days in each month.
February contains 28 days most years, but 29 days during a leap year.  A leap
year is any year divisible by 4, except that a year divisible by 100 is not a
leap year, except that a year divisible by 400 is a leap year after all.
Hence, 1800 and 1900 are not leap years, but 1600 and 2000 are.  (Implement
this rule in your program even if you know information to the contrary.)

  /** Checks whether the given year is a leap year.
   *  @return true if and only if the input year is a leap year.
   */
  public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
    ...
  }

  /** Returns the number of days in a given month.
   *  @param month is a month, numbered in the range 1...12.
   *  @param year is the year in question, with no digits omitted.
   *  @return the number of days in the given month.
   */
  public static int daysInMonth(int month, int year) {
    ...
  }

  /** Checks whether the given date is valid.
   *  @return true if and only if month/day/year constitute a valid date.
   *
   *  Years prior to A.D. 1 are NOT valid.
   */
  public static boolean isValidDate(int month, int day, int year) {
    ...
  }
